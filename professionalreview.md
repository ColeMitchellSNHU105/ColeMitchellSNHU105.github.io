#	Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.

I started the CS program to earn a B.S. degree in Computer Science and become more hirable in the job market. Along the way, I had ample hands-on experience in coding, software design, and troubleshooting. A LOT of troubleshooting. The SNHU CS program may not be the best at teaching complex software concepts or real-world job skills, but it did provide many opportunities for me to solve problems using online resources and trial and error. For example, CS 465 Full Stack presented instructions that were occasionally inaccurate and/or misleading, resulting in my own attempts to rectify critical bugs and issues. I have also never taken an HTML course in this program and thus have worked to learn basic concepts myself for the creation of this portfolio page. After receiving a surface level introduction to software development, I feel prepared to prostrate myself for future employers in the hopes that I can become a software professional and learn some actual skills that will lead into a career.

This portfolio is a great example of the effectiveness of this educational process. My impression of the CS capstone course is no new information being taught and little to no guidance in completing the course. Just choosing a viable artifact from the simplistic projects previously built in the program was a difficult decision. Ultimately, I came to use the Dash-based web application since I could mold it to produce something marginally interesting to me: an interactive table displaying fish memes. This allows me to demonstrate a strong work ethic for producing value in software in the absence of motivation and outside direction. I have doubts regarding whether I show this portfolio to an employer, due to its frivolous nature. My view of the computer science job market has been shaped by outside factors such as social media and my personal job search prior to my graduation. There are certainly safer methods of becoming a more attractive candidate (volunteer work) but if I can make this portfolio look professional enough, it may hold some value in my future.

collaborating in a team environment: lmao, lol even
communicating with stakeholders: what stakeholders?
data structures and algorithms: good work but remains to be seen in the context of much more complicated software production
software engineering and database: simple but efficient designs
security: never taught, but good idea to add authentication and prevent crashing

#	Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.

The Dash artifact is used to implement all three enhancements required by this course. Implementing the fish table and presenting it for this portfolio required a diverse repository of skills and knowledge including Python, Dash, HTML, Git, MongoDB, and public hosting solutions (github.com, render.com, MongoDB Atlas). 
What follows is one of the fictional fish data tables ever constructed:
