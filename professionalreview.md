#	Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped you showcase your strengths, shape your professional goals and values, and prepare to enter or become more employable in the computer science field.

I started the CS program to earn a B.S. degree in Computer Science and become more hirable in the job market. Along the way, I had ample hands-on experience in coding, software design, and troubleshooting. **A LOT of troubleshooting.** The SNHU CS program may not be the best at teaching complex software concepts or real-world job skills, but it did provide many opportunities for me to solve problems using online resources and trial and error. For example, CS 465 Full Stack presented instructions that were occasionally inaccurate and/or misleading, resulting in my own attempts to rectify critical bugs and issues. I have also never taken an HTML course in this program and thus have worked to learn basic concepts myself for the creation of this portfolio page. After receiving a surface level introduction to software development, I feel prepared to prostrate myself for future employers in the hopes that I can become a software professional and learn some actual skills that will lead into a career.

This portfolio is a great example of the effectiveness of this educational process. My impression of the CS capstone course is no new information being taught and little to no guidance in completing the course. Just choosing a viable artifact from the simplistic projects previously built in the program was a difficult decision. Ultimately, I came to use the Dash-based web application since I could mold it to produce something marginally interesting to me: *an interactive table displaying fish memes.* This allows me to demonstrate a strong work ethic for producing value in software in the absence of motivation and outside direction. I do still have doubts regarding whether I show this portfolio to an employer, due to its frivolous nature. My view of the computer science job market has been shaped by outside factors such as social media and my personal job search prior to my graduation. The resulting outlook is grim; entry level programmers appear to be an oversaturated market with few companies looking to invest in new talent. Nonetheless, this is my preferred industry (especially compared to my previous degree in Chemistry) though there are certainly safer methods of becoming a more attractive candidate (volunteer work or an actual passion project), but if I can make this portfolio look professional enough, it may hold some value in my future.

### I am required to include these topics:

- [x] collaborating in a team environment: lmao, lol even. Every project has been completed by me alone.
 > I can't blame the instructors too much for not providing valuable feedback on their competitive salary of two soggy crackers per week.

- [x] communicating with stakeholders: The stakeholders (me, myself, and I) are very satisfied with the variety of fish on display.

- [x] data structures and algorithms: good work but remains to be seen in the context of much more complicated software production

- [x] software engineering and database: simple but efficient designs provide functionality

- [x] security: never taught, but always a good idea to add authentication and prevent crashing


#	Summarize and introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole.

The Dash artifact was used to implement all three enhancements required by this course. Implementing the  **COOL COLE FISH** fish table and presenting it for this portfolio required a diverse repository of skills and knowledge including Python, Dash, HTML, Git, MongoDB, Krita (drawing freeware), and public hosting solutions (github.com, render.com, MongoDB Atlas). The resulting software is ideal for showing off large amounts of fish of whatever variety I choose. Many methods are utilized in the Python code to display the table exactly as I desire. The program can handle a large number of fish, which are easily submitted through MongoDB Compass, connected to my Atlas cluster, utilizing the FishInput.csv file.
